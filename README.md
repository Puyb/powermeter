Do It Yourself (DIY) Cycle Power Meter

This is the code for a crank-based power meter, transmitting over BLE to a bike computer. The whole project is based on Steve Jarvis website/gitlab with a nice set of improvements (see gitlab link below) and tested on a 'Adafruit Bluefruit nRF52840 Feather Express' board.
